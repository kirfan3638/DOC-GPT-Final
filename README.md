# DOC GPT Final

This repository demonstrates a basic setup for a HIPAA-conscious medical note application using React Native and a Node.js backend. It includes documentation in `docs/COURSE.md` outlining how to extend the project with AI-based search across clinical guidelines.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies in both the project root and `backend/`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd backend && npm install
   ```
2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
3. Run the mobile app with React Native.

See [docs/COURSE.md](docs/COURSE.md) for a full walkthrough of the architecture and suggestions for HIPAA compliance.
